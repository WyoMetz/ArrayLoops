         * When Creating an Array we use the Square Brackets [] to denote that the value is an array of values.
         * When we say  = new int[4]; what we are saying is that I want an Array that has room for four different values.
         * Arrays can be made of any Value type. So string, double, int, float, char, decimal etc are all valid for Arrays.
